# garmin-tui

I really want this to be a golang app, but garmin client library is better in python's side, so there's that.

I can stand up a python api and have golang tui app talk to it, but then I need to deploy the api, and I'm not going to do that.

Also if you can't tell by now, I'm very lazy, especially if I have to open a browser and visit a website. TUI gang rise up.

## Install

```bash
make install
```
